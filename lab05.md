## Introduction

This lab will guide you through the process of reversing and analyzing .NET malware samples. We will cover both static analysis techniques using dnSpy as well as dynamic analysis with the ANY.RUN sandbox. The ultimate goal is to develop preventative vaccines and decryptors for real malware threats. The lab materials are available at [https://www.tryhackme.com/jr/dotnetmalwarere](https://www.tryhackme.com/jr/dotnetmalwarere).

## Environment Setup

- Install VMWare Workstation (contact instructor for license keys)
- Download the provided OVF virtual machine image file
- Optional: Read up on PE file format, .NET architecture, modern malware landscape

## Lab 0x00 - PE File Analysis

- Launch the VHC CTF 2023/SuperShy binary in PE-Bear
- Explore the DOS header, DOS stub, PE header details like import/export tables
- Understand concepts like virtual address, relative virtual address, ASLR

## Lab 0x01 - .NET PE Analysis

- Open a .NET binary in dnSpy
- Locate the .NET header, CLR header in the PE
- Observe the CIL (Common Intermediate Language) code

## Lab 0x02 - Redline Infostealer Analysis

- Open the RedLineClient.bin sample in dnSpy
- Statically analyze CIL to identify:
  - Connection to C2 server
  - Information collection functionality
  - Credential stealing
  - Self-deletion routine

## Lab 0xff - ANY.RUN Dynamic Analysis

- Upload the Redline sample to ANY.RUN
- Interactively observe the malware's behavior
- View artifacts like network traffic, file system changes, etc.

## Lab 0x03 - Prometheus Vaccine

### 0x03.0x01 - Mutex Vaccine

- Find the mutex creation routine in Prometheus
- Dynamically analyze to get the mutex value
- Create a PowerShell script to pre-create the mutex
- Run the script before Prometheus to "vaccinate"

### 0x03.0x02 - Decryption Vaccine

- Locate the Salsa20 encryption routine
- Find the random number generator (RNG) seed
- Write a brute-force script to recover the encryption key
- Use the key to decrypt files without paying ransom

## Lab 0x04 - Anti-Analysis Techniques

- Analyze obfuscation and packer used by malware
- Use deobfuscators and unpackers to recover original code
- Patch the binary to circumvent anti-debugging tricks
