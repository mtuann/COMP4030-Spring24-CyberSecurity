## Key Concepts
### Attacks
- Address Spoofing: Faking the source address of a packet to hide the identity of the sender
- Denial of Service (DoS): Overloading a system with requests to make it unavailable to legitimate users (TCP SYN Flood, Ping of Death, Teardrop, etc.)
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): Coordinated DoS attacks from multiple sources to overwhelm a target
- Reflection/Amplification Attacks: Using a third-party server to reflect and amplify an attack on a target
- Man in the Middle (MitM): Intercepting and altering communication between two parties
- Malware
    - Virus: Malicious software that attaches itself to a legitimate program and spreads when the program is executed
    - Worm: Self-replicating malware that spreads across a network without user intervention
    - Trojan Horse: Malware disguised as legitimate software
    - Randomware: Malware that encrypts files and demands payment for decryption
- Human Vulnerabilities
    - Social Engineering, Insider Threats, etc.
    - Phishing: Sending fraudulent emails to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information
    - Dictionary Attack/ Brute Force Attack: Trying a list of common passwords to gain unauthorized access
    - Physical Security: Unauthorized access to physical devices and data
### Defenses
- Security Policies
    - Define security standards and guidelines for user authentication and authorization.
    - User awareness and training on security policies
    - Physical security controls and access management
- Defense in Depth: Layered security controls to protect against multiple attack vectors (e.g., perimeter, network, host, application, data).
- Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication
- Role-Based Access Control
- Digital Certificates and Public Key Infrastructure
- Bio-metrics and Physical Access Controls
